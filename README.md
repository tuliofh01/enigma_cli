## About the app:
The application was solely developed in Python. It reasonably implements military grade cryptography while being portable and light.
It can be downloaded to some usb flashdrive in order to transport and secure sensitive credentials, given virtually any physical 
generic business environment. 
It manages to keep its encrypted records offline and outside anyone's computer while supporting simultaneous different users, 
with different credentials themselves. Therefore X cannot possibly decrypt nor access Y's records and vice-versa. It can be used 
in order to prevent malware/hacker attacks and make sabbotage by any internal parties much harder.
